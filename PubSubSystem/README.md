Alright, to begin, I'd like to clarify and finalize the core functionalities of the pub-sub system. Once we're aligned on the scope, I'll identify the core entities and draft their responsibitlies keeping Single Responsibility Principle in mind. In case there are any variations, these will be avbstracted out following Open Closed Principles and also by using design patterns like Observer or Strategy design pattern patterns wherever applicable.
Shall I start by drawing out what I think are the essential functional requirements of the system?

I had some clarifying questions before I proceed :-
1. For the core logic, can we agree that the Publisher supposed to be stateless, in the sense that it is reponsible to only publish message to the topic without ensuing delivery guarantees?
1. Is the Topic only responsible for managing the subscribers and dispatching messages?
1. Once the subscribers are notified, in the core logic is the expectration that the subscribers consume in a fire and forget fashion? Is there any requirements wrt synchronous or async message processing?
1. Are there any specific constraints we should consider, such as maximum subscribers per topic?
1. Are there any specific performance requirements, such as maximum message delivery time or throughput?

Here's a list of what I believe to be the key functional requirements of the system :-
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
1. Subscribers should be able to register a callback with a topic to receive messages.
1. Publishers should be able to emit structured messages (ID, payload, timestamp) to a topic.
1. Subscribers should be able to unsubscribe cleanly and idempotently.
1. Topics should synchronously notify all current subscribers on each publish.
1. Notification failures should not impact other subscribers.

Now that we have agreed on the core functional requirements, I'll draw out the core entities of the pub-sub system.
1. Subscriber - this entity is reponsible for receiving messages from a topic by specifying a callback. For now, we will model this entity by first defigining an interface ISubscriber which will have a receiveMessage() method - this will be inherited by concrete subscribers & implement the receiveMessage method. This way we'll be abiding with the OpenClosedPrinciple. For the core logic, we'll be defining a logSubscriber.
1. Publisher - this entity is reponsible for publishing messages to all of its registered Topics in a stateless manner. Its main responsibilities are to register a topic & publish messages to all of its registered topics.
1. Topic - this entity is responsible for managing the message transaction between the publisher-subscribers which will be modeled through Observer design pattern. Its main funcionalities are to add, remove and notify subscribers - keeping the class well aligned with Liskov's substitution princple.
1. Message this is the entitiy that gets exchanged between the publisher and subscribers.
1. PubSubSystemDemo - this is the dmeo class reponsible for demonstrating the pubsub sytem.

Before proceeding, I want to confirm if the core entities look good or do you want me to make any modifications to the system?
